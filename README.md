Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems, **guidelines on how to tackle certain problems**. They are not classes, packages or libraries that you can plug into your application and wait for the magic to happen. These are, rather, guidelines on how to tackle certain problems in certain situations.

## Creational Design Patterns


- ### abstract-factory

  The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes

- ### factory
    
  In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor.

- ### builder

  The builder pattern is an object creation software design pattern with the intentions of finding a solution to the telescoping constructor anti-pattern.

- ### prototype

  The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development. It is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects.

- ### singleton

  In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.


## Structural Design Patterns

- ### adapter

  Adapter pattern lets you wrap an otherwise incompatible object in an adapter to make it compatible with another class.

- ### bridge
    
  Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

- ### decorator

  Decorator pattern lets you dynamically change the behavior of an object at run time by wrapping them in an object of a decorator class.

- ### facade

  Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

- ### proxy

  Using the proxy pattern, a class represents the functionality of another class.


## Behavioral Design Patterns

- ### command

  In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.

- ### observer

  The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

- ### strategy

  In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioural software design pattern that enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime.
